This runbook provides the steps to mitigate the Splunk notable in the incident review dashboard in Splunk ES that is threat activity detected.
Prerequisites:  You need to have a threat intel list with you to check the risk score and recent activity performed through malicious IPs.
STEP 1: In the incident review dashboard in Splunk ES you will find the detection activity notable as below in the image. The notable comes from the threat intelligence data model where the threat intelligence collects the matched threat value and displays the incident. The below image can give the information of the fields like :
source IP
Destination IP
Threat score etc.
For eg here the source IP is 146.88.241.105 and the destination IP is ISP.

Step 2: After checking the source and destination IP determine whether the network flow is the inbound flow or outbound flow of the traffic.
If the source IP is Private it the its outbound communication and if the source IP is public it an inbound communication.
On the same page above in the upper pannel go to Security Domain → Network → Traffic Search
Here we will take the detailed logs of the communication
Firstly take the source IP copy it to the source and then select the action equal to allowed.
We want to see only the allowed communication which is accepted in the logs. Search for the 90-day period so that you can get all relevant details thoroughly.
As we see in the logs check action = accept.
this is a green flag to check for the reputation.
The destination port will give information about where the traffic is destined. The critical ports are : 
15 Netstat
20/21 FTP
22 SSH
23 Telnet
25 SMTP
50/51 IPSec
53 DNS
67/68 BOOTP
69 TFTP
79/49 TACACS+
80 HTTP
88 Kerberos
110 POP3
111 Port Map
119 NNTP
123 NTP
137-139 NetBIOS
143 IMAP
161 SNMP
389 LDAP
443 SSL
445 SMB
500 IPSec/ISAKMP
520 RIP
546/547 DHCP
636 SLDAP
1512 WINS
1701 L2TP
1720 323
1723 PPTP
1812/13 RADIUS
3389 RDP
5004/5005 RTP
5060/5061 SIP
In below eg we are getting accepted inbound communication on port 500.

Step 3: Now check the Reputation of the various threat intel (reference link below). The risk score and recent activities can give clarity on blocking the IP.
Check on the Virustotal

check on abuseipdb for recent activities. The recent activities will be shown below stating if they reported for port scan , hacking , spam/fraud, phishing etc.

Step 4:  As we identified the threat ip it's time to block and raise an IS ticket for blocking.
Before raising the ticket check whether the IP is already being raised in the ticket for blocking if yes then discontinue else proceed to make the ticket.
Now since the IP above has not been raised will raise the ticket for blocking.
Now we will export the logs of communications that is the raw logs 
download from the down arrow as shown below in the image in CSV format and give the name as malicious_communication-date 

Step 5: raising block ticket in IS and assign to Nilay Modi.
The format of the ticket should be as follow : in the description of the ticket write about the flow of communication inbound or outbound. stating the commication details with action port number and count
The format of the verifying threat intel should be  as below:
The following IPs are reputed malicious on the following threat intel.
Reputation Table:
IP- 146.88.241.105

||Website||Reputation||
||abuseipdb | screen shot of the malicious IP|
||mxtoolbox | screen shot of the malicious IP|
||metadefender |screen shot of the malicious IP |
Note: you can use other threatintel website for verification and not the ones above shown in example.
We can block the IP.
Then attach the raw log communication file as evident.
